## Upload Your Own Recordings

Already have recording sessions from another tool? Just drag and drop them in.

## Get Transcripts

We automatically generate transcriptions from any recording taken from within our application.

We will also transcribe any WAV or MP3 files that you upload to an Interview as well.

## Fix Transcription Errors

Sometimes we don't get the transcription perfect. Transcriptions are fully editable â€“ you can fix any text we incorrectly transcribed.

## Capture Any Media

You can upload any file to an interview. We continue to iterate on our editor and will be adding file previews and more for additional file types. Files that we don't know how to display can still be attached to interviews and downloaded by others on your team.

## Request Access

See how Clarity Hub can help you gather your customer feedback together and make it easier to build products your customers love.
