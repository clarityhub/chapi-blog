Easily keep your customer interviews organized with our new Tag system. Use tags to keep track of anything from different types of feedback and personas to features and products. You can even add your own custom tags.

## Tags

We have added the ability to tag your interviews. All workspaces come with some default categories and tags to help you get started.
